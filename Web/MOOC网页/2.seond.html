                The story of the iPhone of 2019 was a redefinition and repricing
                of the base-model product. Yes, the
                <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/iphone-11"
                    >iPhone 11</a
                >
                is just the successor to 2018's
                <a

                    >iPhone XR</a
                >, but by giving the 11 the flagship name and cutting the price,
                Apple sent a strong signal that the iPhone product line was
                going to be more accessible and affordable than in previous
                years.
            </p>
            <p>
                Expect more of that in 2020, as rumors suggest that Apple will
                launch the
                <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/iphone-se-2"
                    >iPhone SE 2</a
                >, this time as a lower-cost phone at the size of the iPhone 6,
                7 and 8. Rumors also suggest that the company will add a
                smaller, lower-cost companion to the iPhone 11.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can also expect the
                <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/latest-iphone-12-news"
                    >iPhone 12</a
                >, which should bring 5G connectivity to Apple's lineup. Besides
                a
                <a
                    href="https://www.tomsguide.com/us/5g-release-date,review-5063.html"
                    >5G</a
                >
                modem, the iPhone 12 lineup could add features like a new
                time-of-flight sensor that delivers more augmented-reality
                features, a screen with a faster refresh rate and the usual
                performance improvements from a new Apple-designed processor.
                Throw the iPhone 12 models into the mix, and the result would be
                <a
                    href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/5-new-iphones-coming-in-2020-including-the-iphone-se-2-report"
                    >five brand-new phone models</a
                >
                released in a single calendar year, which would be a record for
                Apple.

            <p>
                It's not a bad way to counter stagnant iPhone sales: Offer
                high-end, high-feature products for Apple's most demanding and
                price-insensitive customer base, while making the lower-end
                models that don't feel like a bunch of day-old doughnuts. Still,
                it's worth noting that this will mark the fourth year of the
                design introduced with the iPhone X and the third year of the
                iPhone XR/11 design. If Apple doesn't change things up, it risks
                another sales slide as a market eager for a truly new iPhone
                gets more of the same old, same old.
