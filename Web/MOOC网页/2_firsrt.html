                At that time ， the sun was already in the west but it was sti
                ll shining . Its light was so bright that I couldn't even open
                my eyes . When I arrived at the East Hill ， the light became
                a bit yellow . After a short while ， it was completely gold
                n ， then red . The sun nearly set . It was like a big red 
                ball . The cloud around it was also painted red . Little by 
                little the cloud covered more and more of the sun . At last 
                it disappeared behind the cloud . It was dark and I hurried 
                back .

                >After school on my way to the dormitory, I saw the sun tanging
                 low above the horizon. The sky was alive with long streaks for
                 ed and gold. The sun, at the end of a day's journey, made the 
                 touds look like the Garden of Eden. Charmed by the scene, I sto
                 od still on the path, conscious neither of time, nor space, no
                 r people who paged by. A feeling of happiness and admiration c
                 ame over me. I was lost in the beauty of nature.

                Dusk is coming. It's time for the sunset. Look, the sky is gett
                ing dim gradually. The setting sun is covering the earth with go
                lden rays. Not only the sky and water surface but also I myseff 
                am turning into golden yellow. Several white birds are flying f
                reely above the water. Willows are dancing in the breeze gracef
                ully. Soon, the sun has buried itself in the thick clouds. But I
                 still can see the beautiful scene in the sunset. It will be alw
                 ays in my mind. I love sunset.
